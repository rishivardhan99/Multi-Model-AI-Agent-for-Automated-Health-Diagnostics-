# Model-2: Deterministic Reasoning & Risk Assessment

Model-2 consumes structured outputs from Model-1 (CSV) and performs:
- Pattern detection (anemia, thrombocytopenia, dyslipidemia, etc.)
- Derived metric computation (LDL estimate, lipid ratios)
- Knowledge-graph–based probable cause inference
- Severity labeling
- Confidence scoring with explanation

## Key Design Principles
- Fully deterministic (no LLM dependency)
- Explainable and auditable
- Safe fallback behavior
- Outputs are non-diagnostic and advisory only

## Input
- CSV generated by Model-1 (`*.model1_final.csv`)

## Output
- JSON: `<base>.model2.json`
- Text summary: `<base>.model2.txt`
